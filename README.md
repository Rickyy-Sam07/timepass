System Design: Deleted File Recovery Workflow for FAT32 USB Drives
This workflow outlines a systematic, dual-strategy approach to maximize the chances of successful data recovery. It begins with crucial preparatory steps to prevent further data loss before moving into two distinct scanning phases: a rapid metadata-based scan and a comprehensive raw data scan.

Phase 1: Preparation and Preservation
The immediate actions taken after data loss are critical. The primary goal of this phase is to preserve the current state of the pendrive and prevent the deleted data from being overwritten.

Cease All Drive Activity: The most important first step is to stop using the USB pendrive immediately. When a file is deleted, its data is not erased but the space it occupies is marked as available. Continuing to use the drive—even just opening it in File Explorer—can cause the operating system to write new data, which may permanently overwrite the files you intend to recover.   

Connect to a Host PC: Safely eject the pendrive and connect it to a Windows computer on which the recovery software is installed. Crucially, do not install the recovery software onto the pendrive itself, as this will overwrite the very data you are trying to save.   

Create a Disk Image (Recommended Best Practice): Before initiating any scans, it is highly recommended to create a byte-for-byte disk image of the pendrive. This creates a complete clone of the drive as a single file on a separate, healthy storage device (like your computer's main hard drive). All subsequent recovery attempts can then be performed on this image. This practice offers two key advantages:   

It prevents further wear on a potentially unstable or failing USB drive.

It provides a perfect backup of the drive's state, allowing for multiple recovery attempts with different tools or settings without risking the original data.

Phase 2: Recovery Execution
This phase involves the software-driven process of locating and extracting the deleted data. The system employs a two-tiered scanning strategy, mirroring the "Quick Scan" and "Deep Scan" functions found in most commercial recovery tools.

Launch Software with Administrative Privileges: Data recovery software requires low-level access to read the raw data from the storage device, bypassing the standard operating system file management. This level of access necessitates running the application with administrator rights.   

Select Target for Scanning: In the software's interface, select the USB pendrive (or the created disk image) as the target for the recovery operation.

Initiate Strategy 1: Metadata-Based Scan ("Quick Scan"):

Mechanism: This initial scan leverages the remaining file system metadata. The software reads the drive's directory tables, specifically looking for entries where the first byte has been changed to 0xE5, the standard marker for a deleted file in the FAT32 system.   

Data Extraction: If a deleted entry is found, the software reads its associated metadata, such as the filename (with the first character missing), file size, and the starting cluster address. It then attempts to read the corresponding data from the drive, assuming the file was stored in one continuous block.   

Advantages: This method is very fast and, when successful, can recover files with their original names and folder structure intact.

Initiate Strategy 2: File Carving Scan ("Deep Scan"):

Trigger: This more intensive scan is performed if the Quick Scan fails to find the desired files, or if the file system itself is corrupted or has been formatted.

Mechanism: File carving ignores the file system entirely and instead reads the raw binary data of the entire drive from beginning to end. It searches for known file signatures—unique sequences of bytes (often called "magic numbers") that mark the beginning (header) and end (footer) of specific file types (e.g., FF D8 FF E0 for a JPEG).   

Data Extraction: When the software finds a known header, it "carves" out the data that follows until it finds a corresponding footer or reaches a predefined file size limit.

Disadvantages: While powerful, this method cannot recover original filenames or directory structures. Recovered files are typically assigned generic names (e.g., file0001.jpg) and sorted by type.

Phase 3: Finalization and Verification
Review and Preview Scan Results: The software will present a list of all potentially recoverable files found by both scanning methods. Modern tools offer a preview function, allowing you to view the contents of files like images or documents to confirm they are intact before saving.

Save Recovered Files: Select the files you wish to restore. When prompted for a destination, it is absolutely essential to choose a location on a different physical drive (e.g., your computer's internal hard drive, not the USB pendrive). Saving files back to the source drive is the most common cause of failed recovery, as the save process itself can overwrite the deleted data you are trying to retrieve.

Verify Integrity: Once the files are saved, open them with their respective applications to ensure they are complete and uncorrupted.
